### Information About GIGO
GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) is a learning platform that enables developers to practice their skills and learn new skills in Cloud Development Environments (CDE) called DevSpaces provisioned by GIGO.
GIGO is available at https://gigo.dev/
GIGO's mascot is a gorilla
GIGO's colors are light green (#29C18C) and blue (#3D8EF7)
DevSpaces are provisioned from the .gigo/workspace.yaml file in a developer's project.
DevSpaces are docker containers running on sysbox-runc (to enable nested virtualization) and are provisioned with a full Linux OS, VSCode, and a full development environment.
DevSpaces run inside a k8s cluster and are accessible via a web based IDE that is accessible from any modern web browser.
Anyone can create a project on GIGO and use the platform to learn new skills and practice existing skills.
On GIGO projects are called Challenges and Attempts are how developers fork a project to make edits and practice their skills.
Challenges are divided into 4 categories:
  - Interactive: Challenges accompanies by interactive tutorials (that are found in the .gigo/.tutorials folder) that guide the developer through the challenge. The tutorials are written in markdown and are rendered in the GIGO IDE using the GIGO Developer VSCode extension.
  - Playground: Challenges that have no clear goal, simply a complete project and development environment for the developer to explore and learn from.
  - Casual: Challenges that are designed to be completed with a set of evaluations (defined in the EVALUATION.md file) that are weighed against the developer's Attempt to determine if the challenge has been completed.
  - Competitive: Challenges that are just like Casual except there are leaderboards that rank the developers based on their performance on the challenge.

# GIGO Code Monkey

###### Code Monkey is a discord bot that hangs out in the [GIGO Dev](https://www.gigo.dev) Discord server https://discord.gg/learnprogramming

This codebase is not a production-grade chatbot. Most of it is hacked together and is constantly changing. Lazy programming is used all over this codebase!!!

Code Monkey was derived from the GIGO Dev challenge [Discord Chat Bot With Llama.Cpp And GGML](https://www.gigo.dev/challenge/1688591240871804928)
